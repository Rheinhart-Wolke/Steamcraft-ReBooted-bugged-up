===================
Steamcraft-ReBooted
===================

The continuation of Proloe's Steamcraft.

This mod is a continuation project of Proloe's original Steamcraft, 
since they decided that they could no longer update/maintain their mod, 
I have taken it upon myself to attempt the continuation of this mod.

This continuation is open source with a GPLV3 licence.
A link to Proloe's Original project & source code can be found here:
